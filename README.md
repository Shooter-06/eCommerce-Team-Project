- Our server's IP address is:138.197.138.231

This project was created based on the discussion of me and my teammates about what GNU/Linux scenario that we want to develop which consists of hosting a website created in the VPS . Using some samples and examples we got form different open sources. We intend to create more like a web server with RTMP capability built into it that is dedicated to delivering live or on demand video content to the users with computer, smart tv or mobile device.
